## important shit

# 1 - The year on year trend clearly shows that the #passengers have been increasing without fail.
# 2 - The variance and the mean value in July and August is much higher than rest of the months.
# 3 - Even though the mean value of each month is quite different their variance is small. Hence,
#     we have strong seasonal effect with a cycle of 12 months or less.


# ARMA

#  ARMA model, AR stands for auto-regression and MA stands for moving average

# We see that the series is stationary enough to do any kind of time series modelling.

# Clearly, the decay of ACF chart is very slow, which means that the population is not stationary.
# We have already discussed above that we now intend to regress on the difference of logs rather than log directly.
# Letâ€™s see how ACF and PACF curve come out after regressing on the difference.
